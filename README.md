# Know how to make a PR on GitHub

This challenge will be useful in all other challenges : Make sure you know how to fork a repository, fix an issue, and create a Pull Request on this project.

## Your goal

Someone made a bad typo in this `README.md` file. Can you fix that ?

## Variant 1 : Using the GitHub website

## Variant 2 : Manually

Fork the project, clone it on your computer, edit the file, make sure your git is properly configured, push the result on your fork, and open a PR on the GitHub website

## Variant 2.1 : Manually, but with GitHub CLI

Same as 2, but you can push and open a PR with `gh pr create`
